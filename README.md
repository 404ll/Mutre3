# The Last Seed 🌱 ｜ [中文](https://github.com/404ll/Mutre3/blob/main/README_CN.md)

## Lore / Background

💻 When the World Computer collapsed, digital gold ran dry, and humanity fell into the long winter of computation…
The blockchain entered its terminal epoch.

Only one sanctuary remained untainted — the [Sui Network](https://sui.io/),
a final **pure water source** amidst the ruins, preserved by its low gas and high throughput.
And within this last cradle of life, an ancient legend endures:

Sealed within the Genesis Wallet were two sacred relics:

* A single drop of **Genesis Sui** 💧
* A mysterious **Seed — the Last Seed** 🌱

✨ It is said that if someone dares to offer their final computational essence —
to **irrigate** this Seed and awaken it:

* On-chain souls shall rise from the dead
* Exiled wallets shall find their way home
* Computation shall pulse once more
* And the world shall be **rebooted**

But now, most remain lost in illusions of speculation,
squeezing the final drops of SUI for scraps of fleeting yield.

🙏 **Only the true believers**,
those willing to surrender short-term gain and irrigate the Seed with HOH,
can awaken on-chain life in the name of **Cultivation**,
and become the final **Cultivators** of this era.

## Irrigation Ritual

💧 Convert your SUI into HOH to gain the right to irrigate the Seed;
🪷 Each irrigation consumes **0.1 HOH** — a small but sacred sacrifice of belief;
🌿 The deeper your cultivation, the stronger your influence. Your efforts will be carved into the Seed’s growth itself.

💀 While others chase vanishing profits, you’re nurturing a true rebirth.
This is no investment — it’s a ritual.
This is no strategy — it’s rebellion.

Only the **true degens** will dare step into this forbidden soil —
to awaken the Second Germination of the Chain.
