# **[The Last Seed](https://github.com/your-repo-link) 🌱** | [中文](https://github.com/404ll/Mutre3/blob/main/README_CN.md)

## **Background**  

💻 When the world's computers collapsed and digital gold dried up, humanity plunged into a computational winter...  

⛓️ In the final epoch of blockchain, the **[Sui Network](https://sui.io/)** became the last "pure water source" 💧 — its low gas fees and high throughput kept it uncontaminated, the only chain capable of preserving life's data.  

🔮 Legend speaks of a **Genesis Wallet**, sealed within it two treasures:  
- A single drop of the original **Sui (Genesis Drop)** 💧
- The mysterious **Last Seed** 🌱  

✨ It is said that if someone nourishes this seed with the last remaining computational resources, allowing it to sprout, then:  
- The lost souls of the on-chain world will be revived 👻  
- The exiled migrants will return  
- Computational power will be restored ⚡  
- And the world will **reboot**  

💀 Yet in these ruins, the greedy still seek to drain the last drop of Sui for profit.  

🙏 Only the **true believers** are willing to sacrifice short-term gains for **cultivation**, bearing the responsibility — and the hope — of **rebooting the world**...
