# **The Last Seed** 

## **Background**  

When the world's computers collapsed and digital gold dried up, humanity plunged into a computational winter...  

In the final epoch of blockchain, the **Sui Network** became the last "pure water source"—its low gas fees and high throughput kept it uncontaminated, the only chain capable of preserving life’s data.  

Legend speaks of a **Genesis Wallet**, sealed within it two treasures:  
- A single drop of the original **Sui (Genesis Drop)**  
- A mysterious **Seed (The Last Seed)**  

It is said that if someone nourishes this seed with the last remaining computational resources, allowing it to sprout, then:  
- The lost souls of the on-chain world will be revived,  
- The exiled migrants will return,  
- Computational power will be restored,  
- And the world will **reboot**.  

Yet, in these ruins, the greedy still seek to drain the last drop of Sui for profit.  

Only the **true believers** are willing to sacrifice short-term gains for **cultivation**, bearing the responsibility—and the hope—of **rebooting the world**...
